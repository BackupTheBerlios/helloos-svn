COMPILING HelloOS

   In order to compile HelloOS you will need following tools:
      * Make
         Actually, you *can* compile without it, by
         your own /dev/hands.

      * GCC C-compiler
         Some parts of the code (especially inline asm) are
         gcc-specific and probably wont to compile with other
         tools. If you are able to compile HelloOS without gcc
         please let me know!

      * GCC C-compiler for i386-aout target
         To compile demo programs for HelloOS you have to install
         gcc for i386-aout, because HelloOS only supports the
         a.out binary format. But you're able to compile HelloOS
         without these demos, but it will be not so interesting.

      * dev86 package (as86 and ld86)
         Bootsector if written with as86 assembler. I think it
         wont to compile with other assembler.

      To compile both the bootsector and the kernel just type:
         $ make depend
         $ make
      In result you'll receive these files: "boot.bin", "hello"
      and several "*.out" files. "boot.bin" is the bootsector for
      FAT12-floppy. "hello" is the kernel. "*.out" files are
      binaries in a.out-format. These files can be runned with
      'exe <filename>' console command under HelloOS

      If you will not run 'make depend' it'll compile anyway but
      there is can be some warnings.

      In standard source and binary distribution of version 0.0d
      there are two demo programs: 'test.out' and 'gp.out'. Both
      of these binaries are compiled from one C-program 'test.c'.
      Both of the programs just blinks with screen characters in
      bottom line. It sounds too easy, but it costs me several
      long long nights...  There is only difference between 'test.out'
      and 'gp.out': the second one invokes General Protection Fault
      after half-second ;) HelloOS must handle this gracefully.


INSTALLING

      To make bootable floppy image type:
         $ make image
      You will receive file 'image' with floppy image.
      To install HelloOS on floppy, insert floppy into /dev/fd0
      and type:
         $ make install
      (this command suggests that /mnt/floppy is a mount point
      for /dev/fd0)
      Your files on this floppy will NOT be erased, but it is
      a risk to destroy the filesystem if this floppy is not
      standard DOS-formatted one. See comments in boot.S (in
      russian ;) ).

WWW
      Visit our site: http://helloos.berlios.de and HelloOS's
      project page on http://developer.berlios.de/projects/helloos.
      There you can find latest releases of HelloOS, bug tracking
      system, get support and get latest testing sources snapshot
      via Subversion (SVN).
      

FEATURES

These commands are supported in the console:
   * clear     -  clears the screen (except the bottom line)

   * exe <filename> - loads specified a.out file into memory
                  and creates new process for it. See comments
                  above on what demos included in the sources.

   * info <filename> - prints headers of specified a.out-binary file

   * ps        -  lists all processes in the system

   * kill <pid> - kills process with specified PID (see 'ps' list)

   * pages <pid> - prints memory usage by process with specified PID
                  (see 'ps' list)

   * panic     -  invokes the System Panic ;)

   * reboot    -  reboots the computer

   * gp        -  invokes General Protection Fault in main process.
                  Main process will be killed after it.

   * fat       -  invokes the simple FAT browser. It is no way
                  to leave it.

   * dbg       -  invokes the debugger when running under Bochs

   * cli       -  disables interrupts (and stops all processes
                  except the main one)

   * sti       -  enables interrupts

   * beep      -  invokes a beeeep with PC-speaker. It is no
                  way to stop it.

   * cpu       -  prints some information about your CPU
